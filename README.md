Simulation and modeling of natural processes by University of Geneva
https://www.coursera.org/learn/modeling-simulation-natural-processes/home/info

This course gives an introduction to modeling methods and simulation tools for a wide range of natural phenomena. The different methodologies that are presented can be applied to very wide range of topics such as fluid motion, stellar dynamics, population evolution and so on. This course does not intend to go deeply into any numerical method or process and does not provide any recipe for the resolution of a particular problem. It is rather a basic guideline towards different methodologies that can be applied to solve any kind of problem.

Python version 2.7 has been used for the development process.
